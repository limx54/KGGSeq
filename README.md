KGGSeq is a software platform constituted of Bioinformatics and statistical genetics functions making use of valuable biologic resources and knowledge for sequencing-based genetic mapping of variants/genes responsible for human diseases/traits. Simply, KGGSeq is like a fishing rod facilitating geneticists to fish the genetic determinants of human diseases/traits in the big sea of DNA sequences. Compared with other genetic tools like plink/seq, KGGSeq paid more attention downstream analysis of genetic mapping. Currently, a comprehensive and efficient framework was newly implemented on KGGSeq to filter and prioritize genetic variants from whole exome sequencing data.

Important new features of KGGSeq v1.0+ you may be interested in:
1. Improved capacity to process whole genome sequencing data of large sample IN PARALLEL with REASONABLE AMOUNT of memory, say, < 10GB;
2. Pathogenic prediction for complex diseases at genes and non-coding variants;
3. Statistic tests for mutation rate and association at genes
4. All in all, it is a comprehensive unified framework for high-throughput sequencing study of human traits, from quality control, filtering, annotation and statistic test.
